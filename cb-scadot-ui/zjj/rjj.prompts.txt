Provide a setup.sh script to be executed in windows 11 from console (power shell).
This script will make changes in sourcecode, so provide full scripts.
If size is to big to one prompt, please modularize and provide scripts one by one.
If need more scripts to complete the assigned task, please ask me and I will upload those.
Fix current issues that I tell you, try to keep every other code that is working if no need to modify it.
No need to create temp files etc, the setup.sh script can replace the content of the modified files.
Don't add comments that look like instructions to me. Just comments to help understand the code, but short and concise.
If you provided a previous setup.sh that was correctly executed (Assume that if i dont say the opposite) dont add again non modified scripts to the next setup.sh generation.

This project needs to use Appkit components, keep them all. If need documentation please ask me to upload it.
I have no documentation, so just keep things as it is. IF need to create new components, views, etc, use css.
Ask for any source code you need from the file tree.

-----------------

Always show relative paths to all files you create and name.
Print full sourcecodes to each script so i can copy and paste with no code loss.
Dont add comments.
